# CrackingTheCode

## Welcome to the Cracking The Code project
After reading Cracking the Coding Interview book, I felt myself interested on decode examples and solutions to **Golang**.

This repository stands for sharing some knowledge and learnings about computer science and algorithms. Feel free to open an issue, fork the project or send a PR for improving any implementation on this repository.
